Using the interface
-------------------

The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive
but here are some steps to use it :

The url (/home) allows you to choose the main characteristics of
the criminal. These characteristics will be used to sort the faces
which will be used on the following page.
You can select the features you are interested in with the drop-down
lists and click the button to submit the form and move to the next page

The url (/criminel) allows you to choose the faces most resembling
the criminal you are looking for. You can select several faces and
send them to the algorithm by clicking on the first button. You can
repeat this operation as many times as you want. At each iteration,
new images are created using the genetic algorithm. When you have
identified the criminal, you can select him and click on the second
button. It will display the last page.


The url (/resultat) allows you to display the selected criminal in
big and provides a button allowing you to start a new identification.
