Genetic Algorithm

Aim
------------

	The aim of the genetic algorithm is to create new faces based on the ones you selected. 
The goal is to generate faces that are closer and closer to your attacker's with each iteration of the algorithm.



How does it work ?
-------------------

	It is based on the properties of the latent vectors we have thanks to the use of pytorch VAE.
* First, we generate 20 new faces by making a crossover	of the parents' faces (the ones you selected).
* We then mutate those vectors by introducing random variations in their latent vector.
* Laslty, we select the 9 faces closest to our parents' ones by calculating the Euclidean distance.


We then display thoses 9 new faces on the next round and you just have to select the best ones !
