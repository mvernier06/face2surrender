Welcome to face2surrender's documentation!
==========================================

**face2surrender** is a Python application, using the CelebA database to identify a criminel.
It is using a variational autoencoder and a genetic algorithm in order
to propose some pictures of faces. We use several selection of pictures to create
new faces in order to find a face that looks like the criminal we are looking for.
It provides a simple and intuitive interface to do so.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.

For more information on the autoencoder, check out the :doc:`autoencoder` section.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
